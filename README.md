# hair-eye-and-skin-color-detection
Machine learning algorithem (Unet, TF2), PIL, OpenCV2, mediapipe and more for detecting hair ,eyes and skin color.

packages needed to run the project:
1. Tensor Flow 2.
2. Mediapipe (google's face detection)
3. OpenCV2
4. Pillow
5. Numpy
6. Math

The skin color detection can only classify between white and black color only (NOT Mocha).
The solution is statistical.

To find the eyes color I created a dominate color algorithem (very simple one).

as for the Unet model, is ok, after testing, it has 74% success (the mask result of 14 pictures out of 54 turned very poorly).

The model will be uploaded soon.

enjoy!
